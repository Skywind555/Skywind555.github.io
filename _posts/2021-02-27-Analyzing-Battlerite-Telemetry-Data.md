## Introduction

This post assumes that you're already familiar with the mechanics of the game.

For those who are not familiar, Battlerite is a free-to-play Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) brawler game available on 
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504370/Battlerite/).

Here is a helpful [resource](https://segmentnext.com/2017/11/27/battlerite-beginners-guide/) for complete beginners.

The data I'm using is from the Battlerite API collected around July 11 2019 right before API shutdown.

Details of how I collected the data from the API is available [here](https://github.com/Skywind555/Battlerite) for those interested.

For details of how I processed the data to be used in the analysis go [here]().

Due to a fairly large dataset with many columns, there are an endless number of questions to answer, though the data is
fairly outdated and covers only a day or two of games. It's also from a previous patch and from the beginning of a new season, 
so this means that the results of any analysis may not be applicable to the current state of the game. 

Nonetheless, I came up with a list of possibly interesting questions that could be answered given the limitations of the data. 
I asked a handful of old and current Battlerite players which ones they were most interested in.

These focus questions are:

1. Does strict matchmaking actually improve the quality of matches?

2. How often does Triple DPS teams win against support teams in solo queue?

3. What are the most important features to determine the outcome of a round?
